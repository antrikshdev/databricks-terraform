**Databricks Workspace, Cluster Setup and Running Job(Python) with Terraform onÂ Azure**

Azure Databricks is a powerful platform for collaborative big data and AI workloads. To simplify the process of creating a Databricks workspace and cluster along with running a Python script from GitHub as a Job, we can leverage Terraform, an infrastructure as code tool that allows us to define and manage resources in a version-controlled manner. In this article, I will guide you through the process of creating a Databricks workspace, setting up a cluster, and executing a Python script on the cluster using Terraform.
